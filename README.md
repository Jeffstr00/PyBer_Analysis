# PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview

As a new member at PyBer, a ride-sharing company, the curiously-named V. Isualize has tasked us with analyzing company data and then visualizing our findings using Matplotlib.  Doing so would hopefully enable decision makers within the company to understand the data, see trends and correlations, and go on to hopefully make good, informed decisions for the company.  For this project, we were given a CSV file containing information on nearly 2400 rides and their corresponding location, date, and fare.  We were then specifically asked to see how the results break down by city type (urban, suburban, and rural).
